# hello-world
This is the test drive of new repository.  Made some changes in the README and add a few notes:
Learning objective:  To-do is to complete edX and coursera Data Structure courses and complete projects.  
Within next few weeks, it should be done and start the new Ruby on Rails projects.

Before the winter is over, these should be all complete.
